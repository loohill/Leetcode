# Welcome!

Hello! 

My name is Hill, and I love solving Leetcode problems, **just for fun**! 

This gitbook aggregates the solutions \(in Golang\) I wrote for the Leetcode problems, classifies by common algorithms and with my own explaination. 

My motivition of doing this is to improve my technical writing skills. So if you find any explaination unclear, or any verballing needs improvement, or any bugs in the code, feel free to shot an issue [here](https://github.com/loohill/Leetcode/issues).

Hope you enjoy reading!
