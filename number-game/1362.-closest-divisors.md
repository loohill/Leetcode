# 1362. Closest Divisors

* Iterater `i` from 0 to any `i*i <= num+2`; 
* For `num/x = y`, when `num` is unchanged, if `x` increased from 1 to $$\sqrt{num}$$, then `y` will decrease from `num` to $$\sqrt{num}$$, therefore `x` and `y` will get closer;
* For `num/x = y`, when `x` is unchanged, if `num` increased, then `y` will increase as well, therefore `x` and `y` will get further. Hence we should always choose the solution of `num+1` over `num+2`;

Time Complexity: 

* Since we iterate `i` from 1 to $$\sqrt{num}$$, Time Complexity is $$O(\sqrt{num})$$ as well.

```go
func closestDivisors(num int) []int {
    result := []int{0,0}
    for i:= 1; i*i <= num+2;i++ {
        if (num+1)%i == 0 {
            result[0] = i
            result[1] = (num+1)/i
        } else if (num+2)%i == 0 {
            result[0] = i
            result[1] = (num+2)/i
        }
    }
    
    return result
}
```
