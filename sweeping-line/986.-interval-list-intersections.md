# 986. Interval List Intersections



The solution provided here is not the fastest. Since we only have 2 intervals, we could simplify it by using 2 pointers, without using sweeping line algorithm. But the advantage of this solution is that it could handle the case that given more than 2 intervals, eg. [Leetcode 218](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/)

Time Complexity: `O((m+n)log(m+n))`

* By using sweeping line, we'll need to sort all starts and ends, whose time complexity would be `O(2(m+n)log(m+n))`, where m,n are the lengths of A and B respectively;
* Then we need 2 pointers to iterate starts and ends, whichever reach end first, whose time complexity would be `O(m+n)`;
* The total time complexity will be `O(2(m+n)log(m+n)+(m+n)) = O((m+n)log(m+n))`, which is slower than `O(m+n)` in solution.

Space complexity would be `O(2(m+n)) = O(m+n)`, since we created starts and ends.

```go
import "sort"

func intervalIntersection(A [][]nt, B [][]int) [][]int {
    // cornor cases
    if len(A) == 0 || len(B) == 0 {
        return [][]int{}
    }

    starts := []int{}
    ends := []int{}

    for _, interval := range A {
        starts = append(starts, interval[0])
        ends = append(ends, interval[1])
    }

    for _, interval := range B {
        starts = append(starts, interval[0])
        ends = append(ends, interval[1])
    }

    sort.Ints(starts)
    sort.Ints(ends)

    i := 0 // pointer of starts
    j := 0 // pointer of ends
    counter := 0
    result := [][]int{}

    for i < len(starts) && j < len(ends) {
        if starts[i] < ends[j] {
            counter++
            if counter >= 2 {
                result = append(result, []int{starts[i], -1})
            }
            i++
        } else if starts[i] == ends[j] {
            result = append(result, []int{starts[i],ends[j]})
            i++
            j++
        } else {
            // starts[i] > ends[j]
            counter--
            if counter >= 1 {
                result[len(result)-1][1] = ends[j]
            }
            j++
        }
    }

    if result[len(result)-1][1] == -1 {
       result[len(result)-1][1] = ends[j] 
    }

    return result
}
